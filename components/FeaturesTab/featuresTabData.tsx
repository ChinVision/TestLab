    desc1: `Our research in this domain focuses on developing advanced strategies to enhance the delivery efficiency of nanomedicines to solid tumors by overcoming critical biological barriers encountered during systemic circulation, especially for modulating vascular permeability. In parallel, we also seek to harness nanomedicines to augment the clinical efficacy of tumor immunotherapies. To achieve these aims, we employ data-driven design approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) and bioinformatics, to inform and refine nanomedicine development. `,

    desc1: `Our research in this domain focuses on developing next-generation nanotherapeutics for the treatment of major neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and glioma. A central focus is elucidating the intricate interactions between nanomaterials and the blood–brain barrier (BBB) under both physiological and pathological conditions, with the goal of enabling precise and efficient BBB traversal and targeted delivery to pathological sites within the central nervous system. This mechanistic understanding serves as the foundation for engineering nanomedicines with enhanced therapeutic efficacy and translational potential.`,
